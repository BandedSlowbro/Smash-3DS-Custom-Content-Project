# Smash-3DS-Custom-Content-Project

A project to add new custtom content to Smash 3DS.

Costumes

For c0X and h0X, replace the X with whatever costume you would like to replace. Chr_XX, and Stock_X0 should be put in ui/replace/chr/. Don't forget to change the X in the folder to whatever you want it to be.

SFX/Voices

Put Voice  files under sound/vc/snd_vc_(character).nus3bank. snd_vc_(character)_ouen.nus3bank is crowd cheers.

CSS Icons

Put CSS Icons in ui/replace/chr/chr_10 for Original Characters and ui/replace/append/chr/chr_10 for DLC characters. Remember to rename the file to chr_10_(Character to be replaced)_01.tex
