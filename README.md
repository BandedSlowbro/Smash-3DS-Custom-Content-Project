# Smash-3DS-Custom-Content-Project

A project to add new custtom content to Smash 3DS.

All files for costumes should go under model/fighter/(character name)/body/(whichever costume you want to replace)/

Remember to put the files in both the "h" and "c" folders or else the alternate costume won't show up in training mode when using a Hold L Speed.
